# BuyersBeware.org

BuyersBeware.org was created to advocate for consumer rights when organizations are misleading or neglegent, when they fail to deliver on advertised goods or services—obfiscate atypical policies—or otherwise take advantage of customers.

Capitalism works when a consumer and an organization agree to fair trade terms for goods and services. Curreny is the powerful mechanism with which both parties negotiate such terms. Organizations are incentivised to acheive the highest price outcome based on what the market, consumers, are willing to spend while consumers are incentived to save as much as possible. These opposing objectives drive fair trade practices. When a fair trade agreement is reached participants a trade transaction can occur.

Organizations are made of people and people make mistakes. Therefore organizations make mistakes. This can be considered understanble to degree but, when mistakes are not recified or when practices are intentially abusive, captialism suffers. While BuyersBeware.org is a non-profiting organization operated by [volunteers](#community), the primary mission is to **protect the core tennants of fair trade in our society**.

Take some time to [learn more about capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) and fair trade.
